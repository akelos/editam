  # If your Editam application is accessed via an Alias directive,
  # then you MUST also set the RewriteBase in this htaccess file.
  #
  # Example:
  # Alias /editam /path/to/editam
  # RewriteBase /editam

  # If you don't want Editam to look in certain directories,
  # use the following rewrite rules so that Apache won't rewrite certain requests
  # 
  # Example:
  #   RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} ^/noteditam.*
  #   RewriteRule .* - [L]
  
  # Rewrite URLs of the form 'index.php?ak=x':
  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
  RewriteRule ^(.*)$ index.php?ak=$1 [L,QSA]
